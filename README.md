The old story goes, </br><strong>"Javascript was almost a Scheme"</strong>. </br></br> Whether half-truth, complete fabrication, or desperate escapism from the poor-souls staring all day at canvases full of JS -- the reality is, this idea has persisted. Most I've seen bring this up in the first-place, tend to look longingly at the visage of Scheme's "functional", "minimalistic", and more "well designed" features. Imagining them to be much more prominent often than they actually are... ie: I don't think those things actually matter a whole lot. 

What makes Scheme (and all capital-L, Lisps for that matter) a better webdev language; Is its semantics. Its S-Expressions.
